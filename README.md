1) During this analysis, we were trying to describe the logistic growth of a microbial population using a differential equation. This differential equation allows for us to model the rate of change of population size over time, compared to the initial size of the population. For this analysis, I used the progamme 'Posit Cloud' to retrieve data from the Internet, and to write and execute the code.

   I used the data from the file **'experiment.csv'**. This data generates a graph for which we can estimate the initial population size (N0), the rate of population growth (r), and the carrying capacity of the environment (K). **My estimates for N0, r and K are as follows:**

   N0 = 879

   r = 0.0100086

   K = 6e+10

   The results of this experiment show a classic **logistic growth model**, with the population showing steady exponential growth until reaching the carrying capacity of the environment, and levelling off to a steady population size.

2) I will now use my estimates of N0 and r to calculate the size of the population at t = 4980 minutes, assuming an exponential population growth.

   **Exponential population growth equation**: N(t) = N0e^rt, where N(t) is the population size at time, t and N0 is the original population size

   N(t) = (879)e^(0.0100086)(4890)

   N(t) = (879)e^(48.942054)

   N(t) = 1.582e+24


   **Logistic growth equation**: N(t) = K + 0t. This is therefore equivalent to the carrying capacity, K. 

   N(t) = 6e+10

   Under exponential growth, there is more rapid and extreme increase of the population size, and there is no carrying capacity that limits the population.
