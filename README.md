1) During this analysis, we were trying to describe the logistic growth of a microbial population using a differential equation. This differential equation allows for us to model the rate of change of population size over time, compared to the initial size of the population. For this analysis, I used the progamme 'Posit Cloud' to retrieve data from the Internet, and to write and execute the code.

   I used the data from the file 'experiment.csv'. This data generates a graph for which we can estimate the initial population size (N0), the rate of population growth (r), and the carrying capacity of the environment (K). **My estimates for N0, r and K are as follows:**

   N0 = 879

   r = 0.0100086

   K = 6e+10

   The results of this experiment show a classic **logistic growth model**, with the population showing steady exponential growth until reaching the carrying capacity of the environment, and levelling off to a steady population size.
